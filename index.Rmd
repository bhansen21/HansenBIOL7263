# Educational Experience
Hi, my name is Bekah. I am a masters student at The University of Tulsa. I am currently studying snapping shrimp predominantly the species *Alpheus heterochaelis*. I am using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), microCT, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to evaluate protective qualities of the orbital hood.
