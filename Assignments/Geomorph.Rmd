# **GEOMORPH**

`Install Geomorph`
```
install.packages("geomorph", dependencies = TRUE)
```

`Load Geomorph`
```
library(geomorph)
```

Create a folder inside your assignments folder to store your jpeg files. These must be jpegs, there are other packages that allow you to analyze other file types. 

I created a folder in my assignments folder titled "my work"

```
Set working directory to the folder with your images
```

`Make a file list from the images in your folder`
```
filelist <- list.files(pattern = "*.jpeg")
```

`Set scale and select landmarks`

Digitize your photos by selecting landmarks. You need to choose images with a scale such as a ruler in the photo to get an accurate measurement. 
nlandmarks- the number of points you will mark on your photo
scale- the amount in mm you will set

This should pull up the first image you have in your filelist. It will have you set a scale, the first two clicks are setting the scalebar. 
  It will something along the lines of is this the scale you want to set? (y/n). Select y if it is satisfactory. 
```
digitize2d(filelist, nlandmarks = 11, scale = 3, tpsfile = "shrimp3.tps", verbose = TRUE)
```
Now it is asking you to set your landmark points. You can set as many landmark features as you want, I would suggest doing around ten. After each selection you need to enter 'y' to move onto the next landmark. 

After digitizing this, all the points have been landmarked in shrimp3.tps

mydata <- readland.tps("shrimp3.tps", specID= "ID")

#lets you view your data
mydata

# this worked
Y.gpa <- gpagen(mydata, print.progress = FALSE)
ref <- mshape(Y.gpa$coords)

#this worked. the 2 is the second number in the dataset ? lol
plotRefToTarget(ref, Y.gpa$coords[,,2], method="TPS")

#magnifies the difference X3
plotRefToTarget(ref, Y.gpa$coords[,,2], mag=3, method="TPS")

#shows the displacement between landmarks, it is comparing the reference and target specimen
plotRefToTarget(ref, Y.gpa$coords[,,2], mag=3, method="vector")

#showing both plots of data the reference and the target
plotRefToTarget(ref, Y.gpa$coords[,,2], mag=3, method="points")

#moving onto something different
findMeanSpec(Y.gpa$coords)
# returens the name of the specimen and the number it is

# can plot all specimens 
Y.gpa <- gpagen(mydata, print.progress = FALSE)

# this takes the data and however many photos you have with landmarks and takes the mean between all of the points
plotAllSpecimens(Y.gpa$coords, label=T, plot.param = list(pt.bg = "green", mean.cex=1, link.col= "red", txt.pos=3, txt.cex=1))
